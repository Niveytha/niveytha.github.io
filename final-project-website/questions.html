        <span class="home-text02">
          The game is a murder mystery game in which the player takes on the
          role of the lead detective tasked with solving the murder of Mr.
          Smith. The player must explore the various rooms of the mansion,
          gather clues, and interrogate the suspects to solve the case. The
          suspects include Mr. Smith's wife, who appears calm but may be
          hiding something, the butler who is acting suspiciously, and the
          business partner who has a history of shady deals. The player must use
          their detective skills to navigate through the clues and
          interrogations, making decisions that can either take them closer to
          the killer or down a dangerous path. The game has multiple endings,
          which are dependent on the player's choices and decisions made
          throughout the game.

          1. The player can move in four directions (up, down, left, right)
          using the arrow keys.<br>
          2. The player must explore each room and interact with characters
          to gather clues.<br>
          3. The player can interact with objects by walking
          into them.<br>
          4. The player must use the clues/information gathered to solve the
          murder mystery.<br>
          5. The player is unable to discern who the killer is without all
          the necessary clues.<br>
          6. The game is over when the player reaches the
          final screen.

          What does the program do for each user action?

        <span class="home-text32">
          For each user action, the program responds by:<br>
          - Moving the player character in the chosen direction.<br>
          - Checking for collisions between the player character and objects.<br>
          - If the player character collides with an object, the program
          triggers an event associated with that object.<br>
          - If the player collects an item, it is added to the player's
          inventory.<br>
          - If the player uses an item, it may trigger an event in the game that
          advances the story or helps the player solve a puzzle.

        <span class="home-text44">When does the game end?</span>
        <span class="home-text45">
          The game ends when the player collects all the necessary clues and
          reaches the final screen, where they are presented with a list of
          suspects and must decide on the killer. The player needs to consider
          all the evidence they have gathered throughout the game to make an
          informed decision. If they choose the right killer, they will have
          successfully completed the game. However, if they choose the wrong
          killer, they will fail and the game will end. This adds pressure to
          the player's decision-making process and makes the game more exciting.
          When the player successfully completes the game, they feel a sense of
          satisfaction and accomplishment for having solved the murder mystery.
