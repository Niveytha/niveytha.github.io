        Welcome... You have been called to a remote countryside mansion to
        investigate a gruesome murder. As you step into the shoes of a seasoned
        detective, you must explore the mansion, interrogate suspects, and piece
        together clues to uncover the truth. But be warned, danger lurks around
        every corner and time is running out. Can you solve the mystery before
        it&apos;s too late?
